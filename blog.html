					<p class="mb-0">I lift my eyes to the heavens, and watch as the skies part to reveal the horror of what lies in store for Mumbai on August 29, 2017. Below the grey, stormy clouds lies Mumbai’s unwritten,​​ unfortunate ​​destiny a repeat​​ of​​ 26th​​ July,​​ 2005.</p><p>I curse the world as I, along with hundreds of other students, wade through waist-deep flood water in a bid to make it to safer ground. Having only just exited a Meraki festival meeting, I am left feeling disillusioned by the stark difference between the colourful classroom and monotone​​ hues ​​outside.</p><p> “The trains have stopped!” someone yells, and I swear loudly, deciding to abandon my prospective ​​trip​​ to ​​Parle ​​station. Before I can even type out a desperate SOS text, my phone is flooded with messages. People have heard that our railway system- lifeline of Mumbai- has been cut off, and I am being offered ​a ​​helping​ ​hand​​ without​​ even ​​needing ​​to ​​ask ​​for ​​one. </p><p>Seniors, whom I have never met before, and friends alike send me their addresses and numbers, assuring me that I would find shelter within their abode. Seems to me that the people are the lifeline of the city, not the railways. With each text coming in, I feel one more ray of sunlight​​ filtering​​ through​​ my ​​increasingly ​​gloomy​​ perception​​ of this city.</p><p>It has often been stated that there is no time better than a crisis for one to see the true nature of a person. And when Mumbai is faced with a natural disaster, this city blossoms through its resilience and ability to stand for a cause much greater than calamity- survival, despite calamity.</p><p> The next morning, I finally board the train home. My thoughts involuntarily shift towards the sense of fraternity that Mumbai is loaded with, and how this same sense of belonging is replicated in Meraki.</p><p> The symbol of Meraki signifies colours you’ve never heard before, sounds you’ve never seen before, and conversation you’ve never felt before. The void created due to abandoned past endeavours is filled by the feeling that Meraki leaves you with- a sense of a limit tending to infinity.</p><p>And then there is Mumbai- the city of dreams, the land of impossible hope. Grey, during times like these. But what’s best about the rains is that it manages to wash off the dirt, dust, and grime and leaves a clean slate: paving the way for the colours and spirit of the people behind Meraki​ to paint​​ the town once again.</p><p>The conclusion I reached while being jostled in a crowded Virar local is this- you know that feeling of belonging and endearment you get when thinking of Bombay? Where you could make​ ​anything​ ​in​ ​the​ ​world​ ​possible​ ​because​ ​you​ ​have​ ​the​ ​backing​ ​of​ ​a​ ​city​ ​like​ ​this? </p><p>I felt that once again when I joined Meraki. Simply put, Meraki doesn’t just give you a melange of colours- it weaves those colours into an eclectic family, one that is based in Mumbai​ ​but​ ​built​ ​on​ ​the​ ​sentiment​ ​of​ ​Bombay...  </p><p>After​ ​all,​ ​Mumbai​ ​is​ ​a​ ​city,​ ​but​ ​Bombay​ ​is​ ​a​ ​feeling.</p><p>And​ ​right​ ​now,​ ​I’m​ ​feeling​ ​hopeful.</p>

				<p class="mb-0">Meraki is a blessing to KPMSOL . The events are unique and funny. Meraki 2016 was a great opportunity for me. It was the first event I covered through my camera and that gave me Kickstart to become a photographer professionally.  Meraki gave me the title of '' Best photographer of SOL.  
					This time we'll take it to the next level. This time i have a whole team to cover the event. We are more than excited because Meraki is the only thing which lets us have fun in the college.</p>

					<p class="mb-0">Vapour wafts up to my nose and soothes my tired eyes; the canteen’s tea is mildly average but
						majorly comforting. I look around, and everything is a blur- so many people?!- so I sit down
						on an empty chair, ready to bring everything into focus. Amongst the many things that
						NMIMS offers, one that I find most intriguing is the mass of humans present from all over the
						country. Perfect for someone who enjoys people-watching (not creepy at all!), and wasting a
						lecture while sipping chai in the canteen.
						</p><p>(Disclaimer: Do this at your own risk. 80% attendance ensures you will bend the knee.)
						For the sake of those who choose their attendance over passing time in the canteen (wise
						decision, really) here’s a list of specimens, as observed and recorded by your friendly
						neighbourhood wallflower:
						</p><p>The Snapchatters, armed with an amazing aesthetic sense, for whom a lunch break is not
						complete without a flower crown and a bowl of Chowpatty Bhel. (Guilty as charged!)
						You'll also find the ones for whom eating everything on the canteen menu is an integral part of
						their bucket list, and every day is a new adventure- so half the break is spent deciding what to
						eat. (Once again, guilty as charged!)
						</p><p>An indispensable part of the Canteen diaspora is that group of people who absolutely refuse to
						buy their own food, and tap into their parasitic tendencies while feeding on the lunch of the
						poor friends who are too nice to say no. (Not… guilty as charged.)
						</p><p>But perhaps the most significant sight at the Canteen on a Friday or Saturday is that of my own
						brethren: Law students surviving on caffeine, starved of their social lives, craving their
						Saturdays, and praying to the Attendance Gods that they aren't thrown into the
						bunk-then-get-debarred pyre. (LOL.)
						</p><p>As I complete my taxonomy of rare humans, I reflect on what it is that we all have in
						common- aside from the obvious (NMIMS, brains, attendance problems). What strikes me is
						that we have all left a piece of ourselves behind in something that we love. I observe a girl
						practice her dance routine while beside her another sits, furiously flipping through the pages of
						the Consumer Protection Act.
						</p><p>What talents have they left behind, in pursuit of their professional dreams?
						Does another run from the CrPC, only to be greeted by the criminal abandonment of her
						singing talent?
						</p><p>How many Poets were lost to Commerce and Economics? How many found poetry in
						Commerce and Economics?
						</p><p>I close my eyes as a I finish the last sip of my chai, breathing in the aroma of cheese maggi. I
						reflect on how each and every one of these people is a powerhouse of talent, and is bursting
						forth with vibrance, hope, and passion that has yet to be seen.
						</p><p>And here, I realise, is where Meraki steps in. A part of our hearts went missing during our
						professional pursuits- aspiring artists, phenomenal writers, bathroom singers and so much
						more- but Meraki is where we regain what we love. Where you realise that there is nothing
						greater than carpe-ing the diem, following your dreams, and having fun while at it. Meraki is
						where you fit those missing pieces together.
						</p><p>This, right here, is the essence of Meraki. You bring us the lock, and we’ll find you the key.
						After all, as Robin Williams aptly portrayed: “Medicine, law, business, engineering, these are
						noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what
						we stay alive for.”</p>

						<p class="mb-0">Meraki’16 was the spectacle the largely mundane corridors’ of School of Law required to light them up. It started off as a small effort, tons of practice and a tremendous amount of hope. Hope that, School of Law finally had a cultural platform for students to showcase their talents. Some of the memories I have are the dance performances, Sharo’s honorary monologue where she portrayed a woman convicted for the murder of her husband, GPS’s impromptu shaayari session (which was equal parts an impressive display of his Urdu and wit and equal parts unintentionally comical at times for those of us who didn’t understand Urdu/complex Hindi words) during which the entire audience was roaring with applause and laughter. Another fun event was the spontaneous J.A.M competitions in which even two of our professors participated in a balloon blowing event. There was even a Roadies-style “who can eat the maximum number of green chillies in a minute” J.A.M event, which a tiny girl in my batch won by calmly chewing down eight entire green chillies and then confidently walking up the steps to take her seat in the audience, with a face as red as a tomato. “Human saap seedhi” was a hit, as was the hand painting competition where all kinds of drawings could be seen adorning the college walls after it was over from a painting of McD french fries to an elaborate shaded sunset. Post that walk of pretentious bravery, she proceeded to drink half a gallon of cold water and bawl because the chillies nearly burnt her stomach lining.  There were celebrity judges, one of whom actually performed Pinga  (which she had choreographed) for us live. Yash Barse’s talent and performance made most of us go watch him play the guitar and sing again at the Tuning Fork, after Meraki.</p><p>
						But the biggest highlight of Meraki’16 which showed how eagerly the children of School of law wanted a cultural festival was the view once you entered Juhu Jagruti Hall. Not only were the seats filled to the brim but even the steps of the hall between the seats were full of as many students as could fit on them, cheering and clapping, their eyes fixated on the stage. And even after the steps were completely occupied, students found themselves sitting, kneeling and huddled up on the floor in front of the stage. </p><p>
						Last year’s O.C put their hearts and soul into building Meraki. Every event at Meraki’16 had a USP. But it was the participants who gave every event a soul and a memory. An example of this is an event where every class had to perform a skit through dance and mine performed one about a gay student who was confused and fighting for his kind of love to be accepted, both with himself and the society. The performance may not have won the event but it its sincerity certainly won our hearts. Its moments like these which compelled me to join the Organising Committee of Meraki’17- a bigger, spectacular Intra-SVKM level homage to Meraki’16.
